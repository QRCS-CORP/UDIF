/**

 * \brief UDIF Cryptographic Functions.
 *
 * \details
 * This header defines the cryptographic functions used by the Anonymous Encrypted Relay Network (UDIF).
 * The crypto module encapsulates all operations required for secure data processing including:
 *
 * - Stream encryption and decryption using a symmetric cipher based on the RCS (Randomized Cipher Stream) algorithm.
 * - Generation of secure key chains by combining a user's password and username with a unique application salt.
 * - Generation of message hashes and message authentication codes (MACs) using SHA3-256 and KMAC256.
 * - Password handling including a minimum quality check, secure password hashing, and verification.
 * - Secure memory management functions to allocate and deallocate memory that is immediately cleared to protect sensitive data.
 *
 * Two configuration macros are provided to tune the passphrase hashing function:
 * - \ref UDIF_CRYPTO_PHASH_CPU_COST sets the CPU cost in iterations.
 * - \ref UDIF_CRYPTO_PHASH_MEMORY_COST sets the memory cost in megabytes.
 *
 * \note
 * These cryptographic operations build upon underlying primitives provided by the QSC library (e.g. SHA3, cSHAKE,
 * KMAC, and RCS). Correct operation of these functions is critical to the security of the UDIF protocol.
 *
 * \test
 * The UDIF crypto functions are rigorously tested to ensure that:
 *
 * - Data streams are properly encrypted and decrypted.
 * - The application key chain is securely generated from a user's password and username, using a salt derived from OS sources.
 * - Message hashes and MAC codes are computed accurately.
 * - Passwords are validated against a set minimum complexity and correctly verified against stored hashes.
 * - Secure memory is allocated and deallocated without leaving residual data.
 *
 * These tests help ensure that the cryptographic foundation of UDIF is robust and reliable.
