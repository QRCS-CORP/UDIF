 * \brief UDIF Help and Guidance Functions.
 *
 * \details
 * This header declares functions that provide context-sensitive help messages for the UDIF
 * console interface. These functions print help strings that explain available command actions
 * and options based on the current console mode (e.g., configuration, enable, or user mode) and
 * the device's network designation (e.g., APS, Client, ADC, ARS). The help functions make
 * use of pre-defined help text strings (stored in the UDIF_APPLICATION_HELP_STRINGS array) and
 * output them using the QSC console utilities.
 *
 * The primary functions provided in this module are:
 *
 * - \ref udif_help_print_context(): Prints a single help message associated with a specific
 *   command action.
 * - \ref udif_help_print_mode(): Prints a set of help messages tailored to the current console mode
 *   and network designation.
 *
 * These functions are essential for providing users with guidance on how to interact with the UDIF
 * system.
