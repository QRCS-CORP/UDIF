Quantum Resistant Cryptographic Solutions Proprietary License (QRCS-PL)
Version 1.2 - 2025

1. Definitions
For the purposes of this License Agreement:
"Software" refers to the cryptographic software library, including all source code, binaries, documentation, and any accompanying materials.
"Licensor" refers to Quantum Resistant Cryptographic Solutions Corporation (QRCS).
"Licensee" refers to any individual or entity that has been granted permission by QRCS to use the Software under this License.
"Commercial Use" refers to any use of the Software that directly or indirectly generates revenue, is used in production environments, or is incorporated into a product or service offered for sale, license, or subscription.

2. License Grant
QRCS grants the Licensee a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to use the Software solely for non-commercial, educational, and research purposes under the following conditions:
No Redistribution: Licensee may not distribute, sublicense, publish, share, sell, lease, rent, or otherwise transfer the Software, in whole or in part, to any third party without prior written permission from QRCS.
No Modification or Derivative Works: Licensee may not modify, adapt, decompile, reverse engineer, or create derivative works of the Software.
No Commercial Use: Licensee may not use the Software in any commercial setting, including but not limited to:
Integrating it into a product or service offered for sale.
Using it in a production environment for any business operation.
Including it in any software that is distributed, whether freely or for a fee.
No Public Disclosure: Licensee may not publicly disclose any part of the Software, including its source code, algorithms, or implementation details, without prior written consent from QRCS.
Authorized Distribution Only: The Software may only be distributed and licensed by QRCS under separate agreements. Unauthorized distribution is strictly prohibited.

3. Original Works and Intellectual Property Ownership
This library contains original cryptographic works, including unique implementations of cryptographic protocols and algorithms, wholly owned by the author and QRCS.
All source code, optimizations, and implementations are the exclusive intellectual property of QRCS and John G. Underhill, the primary author.
The Software is protected under U.S. and international copyright, patent, trade secret, and intellectual property laws.
This License does not grant Licensee any ownership, title, or interest in the Software.
QRCS reserves all rights not expressly granted in this License.
3.1 Patent Notice
Certain elements of this Software are subject to one or more provisional or pending U.S. patent applications filed by QRCS and/or John G. Underhill. 
Unauthorized use, reproduction, or distribution of such elements may result in liability under applicable patent laws. 
A full list of filed patent applications is available upon request.

4. Cryptographic Standards & Third-Party Components
This software includes implementations of cryptographic algorithms such as SHA3, AES, and others that are public domain or standardized by organizations such as NIST, ISO, or other international bodies.
QRCS does not claim ownership over the mathematical algorithms themselves, but all source code, optimizations, and implementations in this library are original works and proprietary to QRCS and the author.
The use of these cryptographic algorithms in this software does not override the restrictions of this proprietary license. The QRCS implementation of these algorithms remains subject to the terms of this license.
If you require a cryptographic algorithm for unrestricted use, you should seek an independent implementation of the algorithm outside of this library.
